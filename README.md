# AutoML
#### An automated Machine Learning pipeline for faster Data Science projects.

Using Evolutionary Algorithms for Neural Architecture Search and State-Of-The-Art data engineering techniques towards building an off the box machine learning solution.

The main usecases:
* Complete Machine Learning flow for small projects.
* Productivity tool for Data Scientists to figure out which model configurations work and which not.
